## 📜 Residency Commitments

Each builder commits to:

- Living and building **embedded** within the host society.
- Sharing **verifiable proof-of-work** (code, content, coordination logs).
- Participating in **monthly demo sessions / builder reviews**.
- Generating at least **one public-facing product milestone** during residency.
- Submitting a **Vault Post-Mortem** (text, video, or interactive log).

---

## 🔁 Retroactive Logic

- **Host Society** may assign XP, tokens, or Fellowship access.
- **Sponsor** may earn visibility, early reputation signal, or token/equity agreement. 
- **Startups** may receive support in storytelling, fundraising, or ecosystem navigation.

Retroactivity is opt-in and defined by host society logic.  
No upfront grant — only post-hoc recognition and sovereign alignment.

## 🎯 Sponsor Goals

- Gain early presence and signal in emerging societies.
- Support ecosystem-aligned builders in high-agency environments.
- Receive optional retroactive token share or equity agreement in resident startups.
- Access sovereign talent pipelines for long-term initiatives.

> Vault Residency is not acceleration.  
> It is re-coordination — through presence, proof, and sovereign trust.
