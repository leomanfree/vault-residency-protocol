# 🤝 Contributing to the Vault Residency Protocol

Welcome, sovereign builder.  
This protocol is permissionless, you don’t need to ask permission to build your own Vault.  
But if you want to contribute back to this repository, you're in the right place.

---

## 📚 What You Can Contribute

- 🔁 **New Vault Implementations**  
  Add your own Vault deployments (e.g. `vault-v1-zuzalu.md`, `vault-v2-story.md`) to the `/docs` folder.

- 🛠️ **Improved Templates**  
  Suggest refinements to the sponsor-builder agreement, residency XP logic, or coordination rituals.

- 🧭 **Historical and Philosophical Expansions**  
  Add new references or frameworks that enrich the cultural memory of the Vault (e.g. merchant republics, sovereign orders, arcane protocols).

- 🌐 **Translations**  
  Help spread the Vault to other languages (e.g. `/translations/README.zh.md`).

## 🧱 Guidelines

- Use clear markdown structure and semantic headings (`##`, `###`, etc.).
- Attribute any major derivative work or historical reference properly.
- Keep a poetic/operational balance: the Vault is both protocol and myth.

## ✴︎ Final Note

The Vault is not a product. It is a pattern.  
The more it is remixed, the more it grows.  
Thank you for bringing your fire.
